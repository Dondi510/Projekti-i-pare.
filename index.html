    <h1>Wildlife</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Wildlife</b> refers to undomesticated animal species, but has
      come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without
      being introduced by humans.<b>Wildlife</b> was also synonymous to game:
      those birds and mammals that were hunted for sport.<br>Wildlife can be found
      in all ecosystems. Deserts, plains, grasslands, woodlands, forests, and
      other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct
      forms of wildlife.</br>
      <h2>
        Interactions with humans
        </h2>
        <p>Wildlife trade refers to the commerce of products that are derived from non-domesticated animals or plants usually extracted from their natural environment or raised under controlled conditions. It can involve the trade of living or dead individuals, tissues such as skins, bones or meat, or other products. Legal wildlife trade is regulated by the United Nations' Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and  <i>Flora</i> (CITES), which currently has 184 member countries called Parties.[6] Illegal wildlife trade is widespread and constitutes one of the major illegal economic activities, comparable to the traffic of drugs and weapons.[7]</p>

        <h3>For food</h3>
        <p><i>Stone age people and hunter-gatherers relied on wildlife</i>, both plants and animals, for their food. In fact, some species may have been hunted to extinction by early human hunters. Today, hunting, fishing, and gathering wildlife is still a significant food source in some parts of the world. In other areas, hunting and non-commercial fishing are mainly seen as a sport or recreation. Meat sourced from wildlife that is not traditionally regarded as game is known as bushmeat. The increasing demand for wildlife as a source of traditional food in East Asia is decimating populations of sharks, primates, pangolins and other animals, which they believe have aphrodisiac properties.</p>

    <h4>Tiger</h4>
    
    <p>
    <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger"> The tiger (Panthera tigris)</a></u> is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring.
    <blockquote><q>Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish their own.</q></blockquote>
